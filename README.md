Tabs
====
This is an exercise in creating a tab navigation using javascript.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
- To see the app:
  + Clone this repo.
  + Drag the index.html file located in the root of your project into an open browser window.(I was using Chrome.)
  + Once the app is open, choose a different tab and behold the javascript magic.
